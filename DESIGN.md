# Design Guideline
A design guideline for the Pet Plus website. Details such as colors, font types and so on may change as the development of the website moves forward.

## Concept phase

#### 1. Theme 
- Since it is a website for pets clothes the theme can be a bit playfull with the use of brigth "popping" colors. 

#### 2. Color Scheme 
- Company has color scheme?
- Which colors are suggested by the theme of the site? 
- #5AE9E5 this is the main color as it is the backgroundcolor.
- #FAB3C8 this is the accent color (as for now)

#### 3. Hierarchy and layout
- The goal is to sell the companys products so the message is that our products are the best and you should buy them. 
- The most important will be hero section and the call for action, menu bar and top picks.
- There will be different sections on the page. We will have a menu bar at the top, then a hero section with "call-to-action" buttons. Under the hero section there will be a content section with different products either on sale or "our picks". Then in the bottom testimonials from other pleased costumers  and a footer with information.

#### 4. Images
- Images will be uploaded in a seperate folder in the projects.
- There will be both text on the images and a side of the images.
- We will be using clear images
- There might be some blur over product images or to make text appear clearer.

#### 5. Icons
- Yes we will use icons. We will use a user icon and a basket icon, maybe others if we find the need for it later.
- The icons will be colored.

#### 6. Typography
- We have desided to use Sans Serif
- We will use both bold and thin fonts.
- We think we will stick to sharp edges but small details like this may change while the website is being developed.

#### 7. Border Rounding
- We have yet to decide border radius on the rounded buttons. Will write it down when we have.

#### 8. Shadows
- Not sure about shadows yet
